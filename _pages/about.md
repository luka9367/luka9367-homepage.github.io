<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
My name is Fan Jiaxu. I am currently pursuing a Master of Philosophy in Computer and Information Engineering at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, researching at the Network Coding Laboratory (NCLab). Jointly supervised by Yang Shenghao and Chen Yi, my core research focuses on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, Generative Models and Information Theory.  

Prior to this, I earned a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from China University of Mining and Technology (CUMT). Under the guidance of Prof.Wu Gang, my undergraduate research centered on Optimization Algorithms and Multimodal Models.

Complementing my core work, I focus on the CUDA-Q Based Quantum Software Ecosystem for cross-disciplinary growth. Outside academia, I enjoy strolling through parks, watching movies and trying delicious food—these little things keep my life balanced. 

Detailed academic background, project experiences, and research explorations are available on my homepage.

[An Inertial-type CG Projection Method with Restart for Pseudo-monotone Costs with Application to Traffic Assignment]

Pengjie Liu; Linhao Li; Hu Shao; Meixing Liu;**Jiaxu Fan**

- We introduce the iRMILrp-CGP method with restart procedure and self-adaptive line search for solving nonlinear equation systems (SoNE), prove its global convergence for continuous pseudo-monotone costs (no Lipschitz continuity needed), validate its efficiency via SoNE experiments, and show its practicality in traffic assignment.

[Construction of an Advanced ODE Learning System Derived from Knowledge Graphs]

**Jiaxu Fan**; Xiaobo Yang; Huixing Zhang

- This project develops an advanced ODE learning system integrated with LLMs and Neo4j database. We’ve researched core technologies including KNN, PageRank algorithms, and knowledge graph visualization, using PageRank to quantify importance scores for key ODE knowledge nodes. Leveraging Python, we constructed a structured knowledge graph and developed visual dashboards with a web interface.
