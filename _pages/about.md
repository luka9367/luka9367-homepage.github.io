<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
My name is Fan Jiaxu. I am currently pursuing a Master of Philosophy in Computer and Information Engineering at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, where I conduct research at the Network Coding Laboratory (NCLab). Jointly supervised by Yang Shenghao and Chen Yi, my core research focuses on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning and Information Coding.  

Prior to this, I earned a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from China University of Mining and Technology (CUMT). Under the guidance of Shao Hu, my undergraduate research centered on Optimization Algorithms and their applications in Intelligent Transportation.  

Beyond my core research, I have a keen interest in complex networks, queuing theory, and LLM reasoning‚Äîexploring these to expand my interdisciplinary perspective. Outside academia, I enjoy watching films, which helps me unwind, gain cultural insights, and inspire creativity.  

Detailed academic background, project experiences, and research explorations are available on my homepage.

[An Inertial-type CG Projection Method with Restart for Pseudo-monotone Costs with Application to Traffic Assignment]

Pengjie Liu; Linhao Li; Hu Shao; Meixing Liu;**Jiaxu Fan**

- We introduce the iRMILrp-CGP method with restart procedure and self-adaptive line search for solving nonlinear equation systems (SoNE), prove its global convergence for continuous pseudo-monotone costs (no Lipschitz continuity needed), validate its efficiency via SoNE experiments, and show its practicality in traffic assignment.
